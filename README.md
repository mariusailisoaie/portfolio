I built most of my projects using pure JavaScript, aka Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

Some of them are built using React.js. They are very basic at the moment, as I am still learning React but I will keep learning and developing.

Some of the projects use APIs to get the data that's being displayed, such as the Weather Project or the Random Chuch Norris Jokes Generator.
